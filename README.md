This is a course project of programing fundamentals.
The goal was to make a simple terminal based traditional snake game, where the snake EATS, Grows, and DIES.
SCORE COUNT, LEVELS and proper REPRESENTABLE GENERATION OF STAGE was added later on to improve.
_____________________________________________________________
CONTROLS:
- w for going upward
- s for going downward
- a for left
- d for right
- q for existing the game
(input case don't matter)

_____________________________________________________________
- if you die at level 3 or below, the game ends with message:
G A M E    O V E R !
y o u   l o s e
Booooo, noob!
Final score: x


- if you're able reach 4th level or higher, you'll see:
G A M E    O V E R !
y o u   l o s e
dang-! you really don't have a life
Final score: x


- on quitting:
Game Quitted!
did you not like my game?
:(

_____________________________________________________________
COMPATIBILITY:
works perfectly on Windows, MacOS, linux terminals. :D

THINGS TO BE NOTED:
(for master branch/ main project) after every input, player must press enter key which is very inconvenient. however the purpose of making this game was to implement all that we knew and problem solving.

THINGS THIS PROJECT TAUGHT US:
- alot of git was used so git and github interface became much familiar.
- basic git commands like : add, commit, push, pull, merge, branch, stash, log --grapgh and more.
- finding patterns/connections in problem and understanding how simpler tools might actually work for this seemingly complex task.


overall it was a great experience, and alot of confidence was gained in our capabilities.

peace be upon you ✿✿✿
